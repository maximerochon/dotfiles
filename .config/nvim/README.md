# Dotfiles

This is a collection of configuration files and scripts that I use to customize my development environment.

## Description

This repository contains configurations for various tools and applications, including i3, kitty terminal, neovim, polybar, and rofi. The neovim configuration is based on [LazyVim](https://github.com/LazyVim/LazyVim).

## Configuration

You can customize the configurations by editing the files in the `.config` directory. For example, to change the keybindings in i3, modify the `.config/i3/config` file.

That's it! You now have a brief overview of my dotfiles repository. Feel free to explore the configurations and customize them to your liking.
